# telegram-hcaptcha-bot
Here’s an example of something very similar:
https://github.com/TG-reCAPTCHA/Telegram-reCAPTCHA-Bot

We want you to have something about as easy to use and install but it should:
- Be written in python
- Uses HCaptcha instead of recaptcha
- Has good tests and documentation.


It probably makes sense to reuse an existing bot framework so you don’t have to do it all yourself.
